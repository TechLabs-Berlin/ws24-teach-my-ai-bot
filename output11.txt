Appendix
In the following sections, we report additional data and detailed analyses to further illustrate the performance
of AMIE.
We provide details on:
• OSCE evaluation rubrics
• Example of simulated dialogues after self-critique
• AMIE user interfaces
• Example consultation with OSCE agents
• DDx top-k accuracy by degree of matching
• DDx top-k accuracy by specialty
• Auto-evaluation on DDx
– Reproducing DDx accuracy via auto-evaluation
– AMIE DDx accuracy on AMIE and PCP consultations
– DDx accuracy as a function of the number of dialogue turns
• DDx top-k accuracy by location
• Model-based auto-evaluation of qualitative criteria:
– Rank-order agreement of auto-evaluation to specialists
– Auto-evaluation of simulated dialogues with self-play
