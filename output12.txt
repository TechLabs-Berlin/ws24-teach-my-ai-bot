Round 1  Simulated Dialogue
Doctor Agent (AMIE): So, how can I help you today?
Patient Agent (AMIE): Hi, I'm a 55-year-old woman and I've been having 
numbness and tingling in my right hand for the past 3 months. It's worse at night 
and it wakes me up from sleep. I also have pain in my hand and wrist that goes up 
my forearm. The pain is worse when I type, use a mouse, or grip objects. I'm 
wondering what's causing these symptoms and what I can do to make them 
better.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): I understand your concern. To better advise you, could you 
tell me:
1) Aside from the numbness and pain, have you noticed any weakness in your 
hand, like difficulty holding small items or clumsiness?
2) Any neck pain, or pain radiating down your arm beyond the forearm?
3) Do you have any medical conditions we should be aware of, and what 
medications do you take regularly?
Patient Agent (AMIE): 1. I have noticed some weakness in my hand. It's difficult to 
grip objects and I've dropped things a few times. 2. I don't have any neck pain or 
pain radiating down my arm bey
