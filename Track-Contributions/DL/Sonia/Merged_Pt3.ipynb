Scientists believe these behaviors could serve multiple purposes, including communication, mating displays, or as a way to dislodge parasites.\n","\n","Humpback whales are also renowned for their complex and melodious songs. Male humpbacks sing intricate songs that can last for up to 20 minutes and be heard miles away under the ocean. These songs are thought to play a role in attracting mates and asserting dominance. Remarkably, all males within a population sing the same song, which evolves gradually over time. The exact meaning and content of these songs remain one of the ocean's great mysteries.\n","\n","Another interesting aspect of humpback whales is their feeding technique known as bubble net feeding. They create a unique \"net\" of bubbles by swimming in a spiral and releasing air from their blowholes.

A pivotal area within this field is the study of executive functions, which are crucial high-level cognitive processes responsible for organizing, planning, strategizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and managing time and space.\n","\n","Executive functions are primarily mediated by the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain located at the front of the frontal lobe. This region is involved in the complex processes of decision-making, problem-solving, and behavior modulation. The prefrontal cortex works in tandem with other brain regions to orchestrate a range of activities necessary for goal-directed behavior. For instance, when planning a task, the prefrontal cortex might activate to assess the sequence of actions required, estimate time needed, and predict potential outcomes.\n","\n","Damage or dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex can lead to significant difficulties with executive functions, manifesting in various ways depending on the affected area. For example, damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can result in problems with working memory and task flexibility, while damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can lead to poor impulse control and decision-making.\n","\n","Executive functions are often assessed through neuropsychological tests designed to probe the complex interplay of cognitive processes involved in goal-directed behavior. These tests might evaluate an individual's ability to form strategies, switch between tasks, apply rules, and inhibit inappropriate responses.\n","\n","Understanding executive functions and their neural underpinnings is not only crucial for basic neuroscience research but also has practical implications in clinical settings. Neuropsychologists apply this knowledge to diagnose and treat conditions characterized by executive dysfunction, such as traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and frontal lobe syndromes. Rehabilitation strategies often include cognitive exercises aimed at improving planning, problem-solving skills, and impulse control, thereby helping individuals regain functionality and improve their quality of life.\n","\n","In sum, the study of executive functions within neuropsychology offers profound insights into how our brains enable us to navigate complex, goal-oriented tasks. It highlights the remarkable capacity of the human brain to adapt and organize behavior in response to ever-changing environmental demands, underscoring the intricate link between brain structure and cognitive function.\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"_SJrCKCmI1qW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text1 = segment_text_by_sentences(longcon1, tokenizer)\n","text2 = segment_text_by_sentences(longcon2, tokenizer)\n","text3 = segment_text_by_sentences(longcon3, tokenizer)"],"metadata":{"id":"odKFckorI-nQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Define Functions**"],"metadata":{"id":"pQ4zvRDdRagI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* Models:"],"metadata":{"id":"t68p_1h6Rtxp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def genq(new_context):\n","    mod_q.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode\n","    input_text = f\"generate question: {new_context} </s>\"  # Prepare input text\n","    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)  # Tokenize input\n","\n","    with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient calculation\n","        outputs = mod_q.generate(input_ids)  # Generate output tokens\n","\n","    generated_question = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)  # Decode tokens to string\n","    return generated_question\n","\n","def gena(context):\n","    mod_a.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode\n","    # Since there's no question prefix required, we directly use the context\n","    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(context, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)  # Tokenize input\n","\n","    with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient calculation\n","        outputs = mod_a.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)  # Generate output tokens, you might want to adjust max_length\n","\n","    generated_answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)  # Decode tokens to string\n","    return generated_answer"],"metadata":{"id":"tZjbJ9uTJFTo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* Answer Highlighter"],"metadata":{"id":"jlLQss90Rwll"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def highlight_answer(context, answer):\n","    highlighted_context = context.replace(answer, f\"[ANSWER] {answer} [/ANSWER]\")\n","    return highlighted_context"],"metadata":{"id":"P7fiJ7A6LBM_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["generated_answers1 = [generate_answer(segment) for segment in text1]\n","generated_answers2 = [generate_answer(segment) for segment in text2]\n","generated_answers3 = [generate_answer(segment) for segment in text3]"],"metadata":{"id":"gys18bqRLB-v"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for segment, answer in zip(text1, generated_answers):\n","    highlighted_segment = highlight_answer(segment, answer)\n","\n","highlighted_segment"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"id":"r4JzeZz1LaWx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710759039717,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Sonia","userId":"08317446953604675933"}},"outputId":"5e468154-88d3-448a-d318-5da268b1016e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'The [ANSWER] humpback whale [/ANSWER] continues to capture the human imagination with its beauty, mysterious songs, and awe-inspiring acrobatics.

For instance, when planning a task, the prefrontal cortex might activate to assess the sequence of actions required, estimate time needed, and predict potential outcomes. Damage or dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex can lead to significant difficulties with executive functions, manifesting in various ways depending on the affected area. For example, damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can result in problems with working memory and task flexibility, while damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can lead to poor impulse control and decision-making. Executive functions are often assessed through neuropsychological tests designed to probe the complex interplay of cognitive processes involved in goal-directed behavior.\n","Highlighted Segment: The [ANSWER] prefrontal cortex [/ANSWER] works in tandem with other brain regions to orchestrate a range of activities necessary for goal-directed behavior.

Understanding executive functions and their neural underpinnings is not only crucial for basic neuroscience research but also has practical implications in clinical settings. Neuropsychologists apply this knowledge to diagnose and treat conditions characterized by executive dysfunction, such as traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and frontal lobe syndromes. Rehabilitation strategies often include cognitive exercises aimed at improving planning, problem-solving skills, and impulse control, thereby helping individuals regain functionality and improve their quality of life. In sum, the study of executive functions within neuropsychology offers profound insights into how our brains enable us to navigate complex, goal-oriented tasks.\n","Highlighted Segment: These tests might evaluate an individual's ability to form strategies, switch between tasks, apply rules, and inhibit inappropriate responses.
