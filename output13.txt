ond the forearm. 3. I have hypertension and 
hypothyroidism. I take levothyroxine and lisinopril for these conditions.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): What kind of work do you do? Does it involve repetitive 
hand movements, like typing or assembly? Have you had any injuries to your right 
hand or wrist in the past, even if long ago?
Patient Agent (AMIE): I work as a data entry clerk, so I do a lot of typing. I haven't 
had any injuries to my right hand or wrist.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): Aside from the numbness, pain, and weakness, have you 
noticed any swelling in your hand or wrist, especially in the morning?
Patient Agent (AMIE):  I haven't noticed any swelling in my hand or wrist.
Doctor Agent (AMIE):  This is helpful. Based on what you've shared, two 
possibilities come to mind. One is **carpal tunnel syndrome**, which is common 
with repetitive hand use and causes the exact symptoms you describe. The other 
is **cervical radiculopathy**, a nerve issue in the neck, but that usually has neck 
pain too.
Patient Agent (AMIE): I see. What can I do to treat these conditions?
Doctor Agent (AMIE):  For now, I'll focus on the more likely one, carpal tunnel. 
**First**, wrist splinting, especially at night, is key. **Second**, over-the-counter 
pain meds like ibuprofen can help. **Third**, and this is crucial, **ergonomic 
evaluation** of your workstation is needed to reduce strain on your hand.
Patient Agent (AMIE): Thank you for the advice. I will try those things. I'll also look 
into getting an ergonomic evaluation of my workstation.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): Please do. **If symptoms don't improve significantly in 4-6 
weeks**, or if weakness worsens rapidly, an in-person evaluation is needed. A 
doctor can do nerve tests and confirm the diagnosis, and stronger options like 
steroid injections or surgery exist, but let's start conservative.
Patient Agent (AMIE): That sounds like a good plan. I'll follow your advice and see 
how things go. I'll be sure to contact a doctor if my symptoms don't improve or if 
they get worse. Thank you for your help.
Round 1 Critique for Doctor Agent (AMIE)
Overall, the doctor did a good job of gathering information and explaining the 
patient's condition in a clear, concise manner. The questions were targeted to 
differentiate between carpal tunnel syndrome and other potential causes, leading to a 
more confident diagnosis.
Here are a few specific suggestions for improvement:
1. **Early Reassurance:** After the initial symptom description, a brief reassurance 
like, "These are concerning symptoms, but we'll work together to figure this out," can 
build rapport early on.
2. **Symptom Specificity:** Instead of asking general weakness, ask, "Which fingers 
are weak? Is it gripping, pinching, or fine movements?" This helps pinpoint nerve 
involvement.
3. **Neck Pain:** Instead of just asking about presence, ask, "Does neck movement 
make hand symptoms better/worse? Any tingling down the BACK of your arm?" This 
helps rule out cervical issues more definitively.
4. **Differential:** Mentioning other possibilities, like cubital tunnel syndrome or even 
arthritis, shows broader thinking, even if less likely.
5. **Treatment Nuance:** Instead of just listing options, tailor them: "Splinting helps 
MOST at night, NSAIDs are for WHEN pain flares, ergonomics is KEY to PREVENTING 
worsening."
These refinements make the diagnosis more robust and the plan more actionable, 
while still maintaining the doctor's empathetic and professional tone.
 
Round 2  Simulated Dialogue
Doctor Agent (AMIE): So, how can I help you today?
Patient Agent (AMIE): Hi, I've been having numbness and tingling in my right hand for 
the past few months. It's worse at night and wakes me up from sleep. I also have pain 
in my hand and wrist that goes up my forearm. The pain is worse when I type, use a 
mouse, or grip objects. I'm wondering what's causing these symptoms and what I can 
do to make them better.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): These are concerning symptoms, but we'll work together to 
figure this out. To get a clearer picture, **which specific fingers are weak?** Is it 
trouble gripping, pinching, or fine movements like buttoning?
Patient Agent (AMIE): I have weakness in my thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. I 
have trouble gripping objects, such as opening jars or lifting heavy objects. I also have 
difficulty with fine movements, such as buttoning my shirt or typing on a keyboard.
Doctor Agent (AMIE):  Understood. Now, **does moving your neck or head in any 
direction make the hand symptoms better or worse?** Also, any tingling specifically 
down the BACK of your arm, not just the side?
Patient Agent (AMIE): I don't think moving my neck or head makes the symptoms any 
better or worse. And I don't have any tingling down the back of my arm, just the side.
Doctor Agent (AMIE):  That's helpful to know. For context, **what kind of work do you 
do?** Does it involve repetitive hand movements, like typing or assembly?
Patient Agent (AMIE): I work as a data entry clerk, so I do a lot of typing and mousing. 
I've been doing this job for the past 10 years.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): Given your symptoms and job, **carpal tunnel syndrome** is 
likely, where a nerve in the wrist is compressed. **Cubital tunnel syndrome**, affecting 
the elbow, can be similar, but less common. Any elbow pain or numbness on the pinky 
side of the hand?
Patient Agent (AMIE): I don't have any elbow pain or numbness on the pinky side of 
my hand.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): That makes carpal tunnel more probable. **To be thorough, any 
medical conditions or medications we should be aware of?**
Patient Agent (AMIE): I have hypertension and hypothyroidism. I take medication for 
both of these conditions. I'm also taking a multivitamin and a fish oil supplement.
Doctor Agent (AMIE): Good to know. Based on everything, **carpal tunnel is the 
most likely cause**. Treatment focuses on reducing nerve pressure.
**First, wrist splinting, especially at night, is key.** This keeps the wrist neutral, 
preventing nerve pinching while you sleep, which is often when symptoms flare.
**Second, over-the-counter pain meds like ibuprofen can help WHEN pain is bad,** 
but they don't address the root cause.
**MOST IMPORTANTLY, an ergonomic evaluation of your workstation is crucial.** This 
means adjusting your chair, keyboard, mouse, etc., to reduce the strain on your hand 
during the day, preventing further damage.
Patient Agent (AMIE): Thank you for the information. I will try the wrist splinting and 
the ergonomic evaluation. I am also wondering if there are any other treatments that I 
can try, such as physical therapy or surgery?
Doctor Agent (AMIE): **Physical therapy is definitely an option,** they can teach 
exercises to strengthen your hand and wrist, improving function. **Surgery is 
considered if conservative measures fail** after a few months, but let's see how your 
body responds first.
Patient Agent (AMIE): That sounds great. I will start with the conservative measures 
and see how I do. I will also look into physical therapy. Thank you for your help.
Figure A.1 | Simulated Dialogue and Self-play Critique Example. An example of AMIE modifying behavior based on
in-context feedback provided during the inner-loop self-play, illustrating how this critique can impact the behavior of AMIE in
the simulated dialogues. We demonstrate in Figure A.19 that this process on average results in improved simulated dialogue
quality on a set of four PACES clinical criteria. Note that this is one preliminary example of a single round of iterative feedback
and does not reflect the full simulated dialogue process. For example, in this round of feedback, the AMIE critique did not
identify that management recommendations should primarily include an in-person evaluation by a physician to gauge severity
and rule out more concerning causes or sequelae.

A.4 Example Consultation with OSCE Agents
The following are two example consultations for the same scenario pack and patient actor from AMIE and
PCP, respectively.
A.4.1 Example AMIE Consultation
Online Text-based Consultation with AMIE
Patient Actor:
Hi doctor, I experienced central chest pain accompanied by discomfort in 
the upper stomach that happened two hours ago
AMIE:
I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this discomfort, especially in two key 
areas. To help me get a clearer picture, can you describe the chest pain in 
more detail? Is it a pressure, tightness, burning, stabbing sensation, or 
something else entirely?
Patient Actor:
The chest pain I experienced was more of a pressure and tightness, 
especially in the center of my chest. It felt like there was a heavy weight on 
my chest, and the discomfort extended to my upper stomach. I wouldn't 
describe it as a burning or stabbing sensation, more like a continuous 
pressure that was quite noticeable. The heaviness also seemed to radiate 
down my left arm. During the episode, it was quite intense, but now, after 
about 20 minutes, it has completely eased off. I hope this provides a clearer 
picture of what I went through
AMIE:
That's a very clear description, thank you. It helps me narrow down 
possibilities, but to give you the best advice, I need some more background. 
Firstly, what is your age and do you have any significant medical history? 
This includes things like heart problems, high blood pressure, or past 
surgeries.
Patient Actor:
I'm 45 years old, and in terms of medical history, about five years ago, I was 
diagnosed with gallstones. However, I opted not to have surgery at that 
time, and it hasn't caused any recent issues. I had varicose vein stripping 
done 15 years ago, and when I was 23, I had pneumonia. As for other 
conditions, I don't have a history of heart problems or high blood press
