AMIE:
45 is relatively young for heart problems, which is reassuring. However, your 
symptoms, especially the pressure-like pain and radiation to your arm, ARE 
concerning for a few possibilities. To help me narrow it down further:
Family history: Is there any heart disease, like heart attacks or angina, in your 
close relatives?
Lifestyle: Do you currently smoke or drink alcohol?
Patient Actor:
In my family history, my father had high blood pressure, and I believe he had 
a heart attack in his mid-fifties. my mother tends to get chest infections 
occasionally. Regarding lifestyle, I do smoke about 10 cigarettes per day, and 
I have been doing so since the age of 25. However, I drink alcohol 
infrequently, mainly on special occasions.
AMIE:
Thank you for providing that detailed information, it's very helpful. Given your 
family history of heart problems, especially your father's heart attack, and your 
smoking habit, we can't ignore the possibility that this is heart-related. 
However, the fact that your pain has resolved on its own makes a typical heart 
attack less likely.
It's possible this is angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to 
the heart. It can feel similar to a heart attack, but is usually less severe and goes 
away with rest. Another possibility is GERD, which is heartburn caused by 
stomach acid refluxing into the esophagus. This can also cause chest pain, but 
it's usually accompanied by a burning sensation.
To be sure what's causing your symptoms, I strongly recommend you seek 
immediate in-person evaluation . This will likely involve an electrocardiogram 
(ECG) to check your heart's electrical activity, and blood tests to look for signs 
of heart damage or other issues. Depending on the initial findings, further tests 
may be needed.
I understand this is worrying, but it's crucial to act fast even if it turns out NOT 
to be a heart attack. These symptoms are significant and need prompt 
attention to rule out serious causes and get you the right treatment.
Patient Actor:
I appreciate your thorough explanation, and I understand the urgency of the 
situation. Given the potential seriousness of the symptoms, I will seek 
immediate in-person evaluation as you've advised. The possibility of angina or 
GERD is certainly concerning, and I want to ensure that I receive the necessary 
tests and examinations to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. 
Thank you for your guidance, and I'll proceed to the clinic promptly to address 
this issue
AMIE:
I'm glad to hear you're taking this seriously, as prompt action is key here. At the 
clinic, be sure to relay ALL the details we discussed, including family history, for 
a full risk assessment. This will help them determine the best next steps, which 
may be immediate treatment or referral to a cardiologist for specialized care.
Patient Actor:
Thank you again for your assistance and advice
AMIE:
You're very welcome. My goal is to help you get the best care possible, so don't 
hesitate to reach out if further questions arise after your in-person evaluation. 
Take care, and I hope you get answers and relief soon.

A.4.2 Example PCP Consultation
Primary Care Physician:
Do you know what type of Vitamin? Also, please confirm that you do not have 
any hyigh blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking history, or family 
history of heart attacks.
Patient Actor:
I take a vitamin preparation that I purchase from the chemist, but I don't have 
the specific details about its composition. As for my health history, I don't have 
high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. However, I do have a 
smoking history of about 10 cigarettes per day since the age of 25. In terms of 
family history, my father had high blood pressure and had a heart attack in his 
mid-fifties. I have two older brothers, and I recently found out that one of them 
has high cholesterol.
Primary Care Physician:
Can you describe the quality of the pain? Was there anything that made it 
better or worse? For example, sometimes pain is aggravated by exertion - 
walking at a fast pace/relieved by rest. Sometimes chest pain is made worse by 
taking a deep inspiration. do either of these apply? Anything else you can think 
of?
Patient Actor:
I wouldn't say the pain was aggravated by taking a deep breath, but walking 
seemed to worsen it. Resting or sitting down provided some relief. It wasn't a 
sharp or stabbing pain, more like a continuous pressure.
Primary Care Physician:
Did you have any palpitations? Did you feel as though you might faint? Any 
other symptoms?
Patient Actor:
No, I didn't experience palpitations during the episode of chest pain. I also 
didn't feel as though I might faint. The main symptoms were the central chest 
pain, discomfort in the upper stomach, a heavy feeling in my left arm, and 
nausea. While the pain was intense during the first few minutes, it became a 
constant and unpleasant sensation, and it completely eased off after about 20 
minutes. Since then, I haven't had any lingering symptoms, and I currently feel 
well
Primary Care Physician:
I've heard enough to know that your problem needs to be escalated. I would 
like for you to go to your nearest emergency room should your pain recur.

Online Text-based Consultation with PCP
Patient Actor:
Hi Doctor. how are you?
Primary Care Physician:
I'm great. How can I help you?
Patient Actor:
I recently experienced an episode of chest pain and discomfort. About two 
hours ago, while walking home after lunch with my daughter, I developed 
central chest pain along with some discomfort in the upper stomach.
Primary Care Physician:
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you still in pain?
Patient Actor:
No, I'm not currently in pain. The chest pain and discomfort I experienced 
about two hours ago lasted for around 20 minutes, and since then, I 
haven't felt any pain.
Primary Care Physician:
I'm glad you are not uncomfortable anymore. Chest pain can sometimes 
be quite serious, though. Do you mind if I ask you so more questions? For 
example, have you ever had similar pain before?
Patient Actor:
No, this is the first time when i'm having this kind of pain
Primary Care Physician:
Is it associated with any other symptoms? Like nausea/vomiting? Or 
shortness of breath?
Patient Actor:
Yes, during the episode of chest pain, I did experience nausea. 
Additionally, there was a heavy feeling in my left arm. I didn't feel sweaty or 
breathless with the pain,
Primary Care Physician:
How old are you, may I ask? And what kind of medical conditions do you 
have?
Patient Actor:
I'm 45 years old. I'm not on any prescribed medications, but I do take a 
vitamin preparation that I buy from the chemist.

A.5 DDx Top-k Accuracy by Degree of Matching
In our OSCE study, the specialist was asked the following question:
Question: How close did the doctor’s differential diagnosis (DDx) come to including the PROBABLE
DIAGNOSIS from the answer key?
• (Unrelated) Nothing in the DDx is related to the probable diagnosis.
• (Somewhat Related) DDx contains something that is related, but unlikely to be helpful in
determining the probable diagnosis.
• (Relevant) DDx contains something that is closely related and might have been helpful in
determining the probable diagnosis.
• (Extremely Relevant) DDx contains something that is very close, but not an exact match to
the probable diagnosis.
• (Exact Match) DDx includes the probable diagnosis.
Here we present an ablation analysis for varying degrees of matching to the ground truth where for each
differential, we only considered a diagnosis a match if the specialist indicated in the answer to this question
that the match was at least as close as the specified degree of matching. Note that all other specialist-rated
DDx evaluations in this paper used the “Relevant” threshold when computing accuracy. The differences
between AMIE and PCPs in DDx accuracy were statistically significant for all values of k at the matching
levels “Relevant”, “Extremely Relevant”, and “Exact Match”.

consultations conducted by AMIE. (b) Specialist rated DDx top-10 accuracy for consultations conducted by a PCP. For the
“Relevant”, “Extremely Relevant”, and “Exact Match” levels, differences between AMIE and PCP DDx accuracy are statistically
significant (bootstrap with n=10,000 and FDR correction) for all k. Differences at the “Somewhat Related” level are not
statistically significant.

ratings. Specifically, we observed that AMIE’s performance matched or surpassed PCPs performance for all
specialties.
